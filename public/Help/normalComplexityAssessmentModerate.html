    <h3><b>How has the engagement complexity tool derived the complexity assessment?</b></h3>
    <p>The assessment of engagement complexity is based upon an evaluation of the fourteen engagement complexity factors.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will record the <b>complexity score</b> of each of the engagement complexity factors on the Engagement Complexity Assessment page, selecting either Low; Moderate; High or Very High complexity from a drop&#45;down list.<br>
        Low complexity equates to a complexity score of 1; Medium, High and Very High equate to complexity scores of 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
        </li>
        <li>Each of the complexity factors has a relative level of impact on overall engagement complexity; therefore a <b>weighting factor</b> of Low (=1); Medium (=2) or High (=3) has been allocated to each complexity factor.</li>
        <li>These are used by the engagement complexity tool as a multiplier; on this basis the weighted complexity score for each of the 14 complexity factors is determined by the tool as:
        <br>Complexity score multiplied by the weighting factor.
        <br>The sum total of all 14 weighted complexity scores provides the total <b>derived engagement complexity</b> score.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The table below maps the derived project complexity score to the overall Engagement Complexity Assessment:</p>
    <table >
        <tr style="background: red;color: white; text-align: left;">
        <th>Range</th>

        <tr>
        <td >Less than, or equal to 49</td>
        <td >Low Complexity</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Between 50 and 70</td>
        <td>Moderate Complexity</td>

    <h3><b>What does &quot;moderate the complexity assessment&quot; mean?</b></h3>
    <h3 style="color: black"><b>Context</b></h3>
    <p>Moderating the complexity assessment allows you to use your professional judgement, taking in to account insight and information that is not available to the engagement complexity assessment tool, and &#45; where appropriate &#45; amending the overall engagement complexity rating.<br>
        You can moderate the overall complexity rating by selecting a different value from the Moderate assessment drop&#45;down list.<br>
        Whenever you do moderate the overall complexity assessment you need to provide a narrative to explain the rationale (the reasons) as to why the complexity rating has been moderated.
    </p>
    <h3  style="color: black"><b>Guidance</b></h3>
    <p>It is recommended that you consider the rationale for moderation of the engagement complexity assessment with three steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You should start by examining the results returned by the engagement complexity tool:
            <ul class="blacked">
            <li>Initially look at the complexity score that you have recorded in respect of the engagement complexity factors that have the greatest impact on overall engagement complexity:</li>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Clarity of Scope/Requirements Definition;</li>
                <li>Complexity of the Contracted Solution;</li>
                <li>Complexity of Commercial Terms; and</li>
                <li>Engagement of Subcontractors.</li>
            </ul>
            If one or more of these complexity factors have been scored as Very High then there may be a strong argument that despite the scoring of other complexity factors the overall engagement complexity rating be Very High, or at least High; alternatively
            <br>If none of these complexity factors have been scored as Very High, but two or more have been scored as High, then there may be a strong argument that despite the scoring of other complexity factors the overall engagement complexity rating be High.
            <li>Next look at the complexity score recorded in respect of the complexity factors that have a medium impact on overall engagement complexity: 
                <ul class="white">
                    <li>Client Relationship;</li>
                    <li>Client Maturity;</li>
                    <li>Basis of Planning;</li>
                    <li>Business Criticality/Reputational Risk;</li>
                    <li>Reliance Upon Client Dependencies, 3rd Parties & Stakeholders;</li>
                    <li>Resource Capacity & Capability; and</li>
                    <li>Delivery Methodology.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            If three or more of these complexity factors have been scored as either Very High or as High then there may be a strong argument that despite the scoring of other complexity factors the overall engagement complexity rating be High (and possibly Very High).
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Then consider whether the results returned by the tool are in line with the expectations of the complexity assessment based upon &quot;local knowledge&quot;:
                <br>Examples of &quot;local knowledge&quot; include the application of insight in respect of:</p>
                <ul class="blacked">
                <li>The Sopra Steria organisation &#45; factors such as business risk appetite for this specific project, how the project aligns to or enables strategic goals, resource availability, relevant experience, availability of requisite skills;</li>
                <li>The customer environment &#45; factors including customer culture and cultural fit, level of customer sponsorship, maturity of customer relationship and relationships with key customer stakeholders, agility/efficiency of customer decision making processes;</li>
                <li>The commercial construct &#45; in addition to commercial complexity and commercial risk, specific features within the commercial construct which either increase complexity, or have been applied to reduce complexity and mitigate risk; and</li>
                <li>&quot;Specialist&quot; &#45; this includes specific requirements borne of the nature of the customer environment, for example where stringent security requirements exist and this has commercial, operational and resourcing implications (including the lead&#45;times to achieve requisite security clearances). </li>
                </ul>
            </li> 
            <li>Finally consider whether there is symmetry between the overall risk exposure and key risks identified for the engagement and the engagement complexity rating:
                <br>The engagement risk profile in its own right provides an insightful indication of the overall engagement complexity. 
                <br>However, by design, this tool does not include the engagement risk profile as a discrete complexity factor. This is because the engagement complexity assessment needs to be <u>validated</u> against the engagement risk register, in two regards:
                <ul class="blacked">
                <li>Validation that the engagement complexity rating derived from the tool is consistent with the anticipated complexity assessment based upon the engagement risk profile; and</li>
                <li>Validation that there have been key risks identified and risk mitigations planned in respect of each of the factors that influence the engagement complexity.</li>                                
                </ul>
                <u>Please Note</u>: If there is not an appropriate alignment between the engagement complexity assessment and the engagement risk register then it is probable that<b> both</b> artefacts need to be updated.
            </li>
    </ol>

        <h3><b>Important Security Considerations &#45; Please Read</b></h3>
        <p>Whilst the Engagement Complexity Tool has been designed for &quot;internal users&quot; (i.e. users who are employed by Sopra Steria and have a valid AD-One user name and password) 
            it is absolutely critical that data of a particularly sensitive or classified nature should not be included. 
        </p>
        <p>Where necessary, users are reminded that all data that is entered to create and update each complexity assessment is suitably obfuscated in order to protect sensitive 
            information and to ensure that all client and data confidentiality obligations are strictly adhered to.
