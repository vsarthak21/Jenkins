  <p>You have invoked help from the <b>&quot;Fast Track&quot; Complexity Assessment</b> page.</p>
  <p>This page is used to determine whether or not the engagement qualifies as a &quot;Fast Track&quot; engagement
    complexity assessment, based on six pre&#45;defined criteria.</p>

    <h3><b>What is a &quot;Fast Track&quot; complexity assessment?</b></h3>
    <p>A &quot;fast track&quot; engagement complexity assessment has been introduced to streamline the process for
      changes against an existing account&#45;based portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>An engagement will qualify for a &quot;Fast Track&quot; if all six specific criteria are met. These are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The engagement is a change to an existing account; and</li>
      <li>The commercial terms are well established, well understood, and do not feature penalties for late delivery;
        and</li>
      <li>The engagement is to be delivered by an existing Sopra Steria resource pool who understand the client
        environment; and </li>
      <li>We do not need to engage new subcontractors to deliver the engagement; and</li>
      <li>The cost of delivering the engagement does not exceed the &quot;DCR delegated authority&quot; thresholds (or
        equivalent) for the Sector; and</li>
      <li>The nature of the engagement does not significantly change or impact the existing Live Service.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you are creating an engagement complexity assessment for the first time all six of these criteria are
      initially set to &quot;No&quot;. </p>
    <p>You will need to be able to faithfully answer &quot;Yes&quot; in all six cases to proceed with the &quot;Fast
      Track&quot; complexity assessment.</p>
    <p>Where one or more of these criteria is not met &#45; i.e. is set to &quot;No&quot; &#45; then you will need to
      complete the &apos;full&apos; engagement complexity assessment.</p>

    <h3><b>How do I use this page when I am Creating a new complexity assessment?</b></h3>
    <p>When you are creating a new engagement complexity assessment the first step is to determine whether or not the
      engagement qualifies for a &quot;Fast Track&quot; complexity assessment &#45; there are six specific criteria
      defined that an engagement has to meet to qualify for a &quot;Fast Track&quot; complexity assessment.</p>
    <p>This is done by asking you six specific questions. </p>
    <p>When you are creating an engagement complexity assessment for the first time all six of these criteria are
      initially set to &quot;No&quot;. </p>
    <p>You will need to be able to faithfully answer &quot;Yes&quot; in all six cases to proceed with the &quot;Fast
      Track&quot; complexity assessment.</p>
    <p>Where one or more of these criteria is not met &#45; i.e. is set to &quot;No&quot; &#45; then you will need to
      complete the &apos;full&apos; engagement complexity assessment.</p>
    </p>
    <p><u>Please note</u> that:
      <ol>
        <li>If you initially create the engagement complexity assessment as a &quot;Fast Track&quot; complexity
          assessment you will be able to modify any of the six Fast Track criteria at a later point (which will then
          mean that you have to complete the &apos;full&apos; complexity assessment for the engagement in question);</li>
        <li>If you answer &quot;No&quot; to one or more of the &quot;Fast Track&quot; criteria and create the &apos;full&apos;
          engagement complexity assessment this can <u>not</u> be changed at a future point to a &quot;Fast Track&quot;
          complexity assessment.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3><b>How do I use this page when I am Updating an existing complexity assessment? </b></h3>
    <p>When you are updating an existing engagement complexity assessment the tool shall previously have determined
      whether or not the engagement meets the &quot;Fast Track&quot; criteria.</p>
    <p>This page shall only appear when you press Next on the previous (Select Opportunity) page if the engagement
      complexity assessment that you are updating is a &quot;Fast Track&quot;.</p>
    <p>As you enter this page all six of these criteria are initially set to &quot;Yes&quot;. </p>
    <p>If you are still able to faithfully answer &quot;Yes&quot; in all six cases then press the Next button to proceed
      to the Moderate & Submit page.</p>
    <p>If one or more of the &quot;Fast Track&quot; criteria is not met then you will need to set that to
      &quot;No&quot;. Now press the Next button and you will to complete the &apos;full&apos; engagement complexity assessment.
