    <p>You have invoked help from the <b>Select Opportunity & Gate</b> page.</p>
    <p>This page is used to gather the information that is needed to create the key details of each engagement
        complexity assessment.</p>
    <p>This is the first page that you will use to either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Create</b> a new engagement complexity assessment; or</li>
        <li><b>Update</b> an existing complexity assessment.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Please see below some information that will help you to compete this page:</p>
    <a href="#l1">What information is required to Create my engagement complexity assessment?</a></br>
    <a href="#l2">What if I don&apos;t have the OCOD reference number for the opportunity?</a></br>
    <a href="#l3">What is the&quot;Nickname&quot;?</a></br>

        <h3><b>What information is required to Create my engagement complexity assessment?</b></h3>
        <p>Complexity assessments are created in respect of opportunities, which are created and maintained on our
            Oracle CRM on Demand <b>(OCOD)</b> system.</p>
        <p>All that is required to commence the engagement complexity assessment is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The specific <b>opportunity</b> for which the complexity assessment is being completed; and</li>
            <li>The <b>next assessment gate</b> &#45; i.e. the next DCR or BCR gate in the business governance
                lifecycle.
            </li>
            <li>You can optionally choose to also provide a &quot;nickname&quot; for your complexity assessment;
                something that
                might be easier to remember than the OCOD reference number, or the opportunity name.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can type in the OCOD reference or the Opportunity name; alternatively you can find an opportunity via the
            Search for an opportunity button.</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li><b>Note:</b> the OCOD reference, the Opportunity name and the Next assessment gate are all mandatory
                fields; the Next button will only become active once these fields have been completed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>



    <div id="l2">
        <h3><b>What if I don&apos;t know the OCOD reference number for the opportunity?</b></h3>
        <p>There are two ways that you can find an OCOD reference number for your opportunity:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Both of the OCOD reference and the Opportunity name edit boxes have a &quot;smart search&quot;
                feature:<br>
                If you click in one of these fields and start to type characters that you know are part of the
                reference/name then a drop&#45;down list will appear to show you any opportunities on OCOD that contain
                the
                characters that you have typed.
                You can select an opportunity from this list.<br>
                When you select an OCOD reference then the opportunity name is automatically populated for you; or
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                You can press the <b>Search for an opportunity</b> button.<br>
                This allows you to undertake a more extensive search.<br>
                You can narrow down your search by selecting a specific Sector to search within.<br>
                You can further narrow down by also selecting specific Account (within the Sector) to search within.<br>
                This search feature will provide a table of valid opportunities from which you can make a selection.<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="l3">
        <h3><b>What is the &quot;Nickname&quot;?</b></h3>
        <p>You can choose to give this complexity assessment a &quot;nickname&quot;, so you have something that is easy
            to
            rememberfor future reference.</p>
        <p>Adding a nickname is not mandatory, you may leave this field blank.</p>
        <p><u>Please note</u> that once the Nickname has been entered for a complexity assessment it cannot be
            changed/updated.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="l4">
        <h3><b>Selecting the Next assessment gate</b></h3>
        <p>
            You can select the Next assessment gate via a drop&#45;down list; two fields are displayed &#45; Gate and
            Gate
            Description. </p>

        <p>
            When a new complexity assessment is being created the default value will be &quot;Please select&quot;. You
            need to
            select the most appropriate gate from the drop&#45;down list. </p>

        <p>
            <u>Please note</u> that the Next assessment gate is mandatory &#45; you have to select one of the gates from
            the
            drop&#45;down list (&quot;Please select&quot; is not a valid selection). </p>


    </div>

    <div id="l5">
        <h3><b>What you have to do to update your engagement complexity assessment</b></h3>
        <p>
            When you are updating an <b>existing</b> engagement complexity assessment there is no need to change any of
            the
            existing information unless you need to. </p>
        <p>The Next button will be active as you enter this page.</p>
        <p><u>Please note</u> that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will not be able to edit either OCOD reference or the Opportunity name;</li>
            <li>If the Nickname is blank, then you can choose to give the complexity assessment a &quot;nickname&quot;,
                so you
                have something that is easy to remember for future reference (adding a nickname is not mandatory, you
                may leave this field blank); if the complexity assessment already has a Nickname then you will not be
                able to change it; and</li>
            <li>With regards to the Next assessment gate you can change the existing selection, but when you change
                the next assessment gate a <b>new</b> complexity assessment shall be created for the opportunity, using
                the new
                next assessment gate.</li>
        </ol>
