        <p><b>Fourteen complexity factors</b></p>
        <p>The engagement complexity assessment is comprised of fourteen complexity factors.</p>
        <p>For each complexity factor you need to complete two actions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Enter the Complexity score for the complexity factor in question &#45; this is achieved via a selection
                (of Very High; High; Moderate or Low) from a table which is accessed by pressing the Select button; <u>and</u>
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter the rationale that explains the principal reasons for selecting the Complexity score (per
                above) &#45; this is done by typing text in to the Rationale for complexity score edit box.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><u>Please note</u> that:</p>
        <p><i>Both</i> of these fields are mandatory; and</p>
        <p>The Rationale for complexity score edit box will accept up to 400 characters.</p>

        <p><b>Four panels</b></p>
        <p>The fourteen complexity factors are grouped into four main areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client Factors;</li>
            <li>Project Factors;</li>
            <li>Commercial Factors; and</li>
            <li>Capability Factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you first enter this Engagement Complexity Assessment page you will see four &lsquo;panels&rsquo;
            &#45; labelled as
            Client Factors; Project Factors; Commercial Factors; and Capability Factors.<br>
            By default these panels are &quot;collapsed&quot;.
        </p>


        <p><b>Navigation between panels</b></p>
        <p>
            At the end of each panel there is a right arrow symbol &quot;<b>></b>&quot;. When you click on this right arrow
            symbol the
            panel will open up and you will be able to enter or change the Complexity score and Rationale for complexity
            score for each of the complexity factors within the panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point there is an up arrow &quot;<b>^</b>&quot; at the end of the panel. When you click on this up arrow
            the panel
            shall collapse and you can open up a different panel.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the panel there are two buttons &#45; Save and Next.</p>
        <p>When you press the Next button the panel that you are in will collapse and the tool will open up so that you
            can enter or change the Complexity score and Rationale for complexity score for each of the complexity
            factors within that panel.

        </p>

        <p><b>Completing the complexity assessment</b></p>
        <p>At the end of each panel there is an &quot;<b>x/y</b>&quot; counter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The x shows you how many of the complexity factors within the panel have been completed; and</li>
            <li>The y shows you how many complexity factors there are in total within the panel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You cannot proceed from this page until all fourteen complexity factors have been completed.
        </p>
        <p>Once all fourteen complexity factors have been completed then press the Next button on the last (Capability
            Factors) panel to proceed to the Moderate & Submit page.</p>
        <p><u>Please note</u> that this Next button will remain disabled until all fourteen complexity factors have been
            completed.</p>


        <p><b>Saving the complexity assessment</b></p>
        <p>At the bottom of each of the four panels there are is a Save button.</p>
        <p>You can press Save at any time to change the engagement complexity assessment that you are creating, or to
            save the changes that you have made to an existing complexity assessment that you are updating.</p>
        <p>The Back button on the bottom of this page will let you navigate back to previous pages.</p>

            <h3><b>Important Security Considerations &#45; Please Read</b></h3>
            <p>Whilst the Engagement Complexity Tool has been designed for &quot;internal users&quot; (i.e. users who are employed by Sopra Steria and have a valid AD-One user name and password) 
              it is absolutely critical that data of a particularly sensitive or classified nature should not be included. 
            </p>
            <p>Where necessary, users are reminded that all data that is entered to create and update each complexity assessment is suitably obfuscated in order to protect sensitive 
              information and to ensure that all client and data confidentiality obligations are strictly adhered to.
            </p>

        <h3><b>How do I use this page when I am Creating a new complexity assessment?</b></h3>
        <p>You need to complete the details required for each of the fourteen complexity factors, by navigating through
            each of the four panels. </p>
        <p>Once all fourteen complexity factors have been completed then press the Next button on the last (Capability
            Factors) panel to proceed to the Moderate & Submit page.</p>
        <p>You can partially complete your engagement complexity assessment, press Save and then navigate back to
            previous pages by using the Back button at the bottom of this Engagement Complexity Assessment page.</p>
        <p><u>Please note:</u> Please follow the guidance provided on this help page for How do I complete this page?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="l4">
        <h3><b>How do I use this page when I am Updating an existing complexity assessment?</b></h3>
        <p>You can make whatever changes are required to any of the fourteen complexity factors, by navigating through
            each of the four panels.</p>
        <p>Once your changes have been made &#45; ensuring that all fourteen complexity factors have been completed
            &#45; then
            press the Next button on the last (Capability Factors) panel to proceed to the Moderate & Submit page.</p>
        <p>You can come back to your engagement complexity assessment and make further changes at any point by pressing Save and then navigating back to previous pages by using the Back button
            at the bottom of this Engagement Complexity Assessment page.</p>
