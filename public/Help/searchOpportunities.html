<h3><b>The Sector Lookup</b></h3>
<p>There is a Sector drop&#45;down list.</p>
<p>You can use this to narrow down the list of OCOD opportunities, to only display opportunities that &apos;belong&apos; to the sector or JV that you have selected.</p>
<p>This drop&#45;down list shows each of the possible values for sector within OCOD:</p>
<p>For example: ADS1&#45;Defence Sector or ADS4&#45;Secure (where the Super Sector is &quot;Aerospace Defence & Security&quot;, as denoted by the prefix in the Sector Name of &quot;ADS&quot;).</p>
<p> The drop&#45;down list will display these values in alphabetical order (A to Z), sorted by Sector.</p>

<div id="l2">
<h3><b>The Account Lookup</b></h3>
<p>There is also an Account drop&#45;down list.</p>
<p>This drop&#45;down list will only be active when you have selected from the Sector drop&#45;down list.</p>
<p>You can use this to narrow down the list of OCOD opportunities, to only display opportunities that &apos;belong&apos; to the sector or JV &#45; <u>and the account</u> &#45; that you have selected.</p>

<p>For example: MOD Southern Services (where the Sector is &quot;ADS4&#45;Secure&quot;)</p>
<p>The drop&#45;down list will display these values in alphabetical order (A to Z).</p>
