            <h3><b>How do I use this page?</b></h3>
            <p>From this page you can specify a series of <b>search criteria</b> to help you find the engagement complexity assessment, or range of engagement complexity assessments that you need. They have been designed to help you &apos;narrow down&apos; your search.<br>
            When you have specified your search criteria press the Next button.  This will navigate you to the Search Results page, which provides you with a list from which you can select one or more existing engagement complexity assessments.<br>
            None of the search criteria are mandatory fields; pressing the Next button as soon as you enter this page is effectively a &quot;find all&quot; option.<br>
            In the same way, leaving one of the search criteria blank is effectively specifying &quot;all&quot;.<br></p>
            The search criteria are:
            <ul>
                <li>Sector;</li>
                <li>Account;</li>
                <li>OCOD reference;</li>
                <li>Opportunity name;</li>
                <li>Data created &#45; from; and</li>
                <li>Date created &#45; to.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both the Sector and Account fields are drop&#45;down lists from which you can make a selection. These will help you narrow down your search if you are trying to find a specific engagement complexity assessment to update &#45; equally they will constrain the list of engagement complexity assessments that will appear in your engagement complexity report.
            <br>The Data created from and to dates will work in a comparable way. These are data fields that let you select dates from a calendar so you can specify a date range and only retrieve engagement complexity assessments that were submitted (i.e. either created or last updated) between that date range.
            <br>The OCOD reference and Opportunity name are on this page to help you find a specific engagement complexity assessment &#45; either to update, of for which you want to download the engagement complexity assessment report. These are both edit boxes which have a &quot;smart search&quot; feature; they also have a link to a <i>lookup</i> feature (displayed as a magnifying glass icon). 
            </p>
                        
            </div>
            
            
            
            <div id="l2">
            <h3><b>How do I find one specific engagement complexity assessment?</b></h3>
            <p>You can specify search criteria that will narrow down the list of &apos;matching&apos; engagement complexity assessments to a more manageable size and press the Next button to navigate to the Search Results page, from which you can select the engagement complexity assessment that you need.
                <br>If you have an understanding of the opportunity for which the engagement complexity assessment has been created, then it may be quicker to use either the OCOD reference or Opportunity name &#45; either using the &quot;smart search&quot; feature or the lookup feature (displayed as a magnifying glass icon).

                    <h3><b>The Sector Lookup</b></h3>
                    <p>There is a Sector drop&#45;down list.<br>
                    You can use this to narrow down the list of OCOD opportunities, to only display opportunities that &apos;belong&apos; to the sector or JV that you have selected.<br>
                    This drop&#45;down list shows each of the possible values for sector within OCOD:<br>
                    For example: ADS1&#45;Defence Sector or ADS4&#45;Secure (where the Super Sector is &quot;Aerospace Defence & Security&quot;, as denoted by the prefix in the Sector Name of &quot;ADS&quot;).<br>
                    The drop&#45;down list will display these values in alphabetical order (A to Z), sorted by Sector.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="l4">
                    <h3><b>The Account Lookup</b></h3>
                    <p>There is also an Account drop&#45;down list.<br>
                    This drop&#45;down list will only be active when you have selected from the Sector drop&#45;down list.<br>
                    You can use this to narrow down the list of OCOD opportunities, to only display opportunities that &apos;belong&apos; to the sector or JV &#45; <u>and the account</u> &#45; that you have selected.<br>
                    This drop&#45;down list shows all of the possible values for account within OCOD, for the specific sector that you have selected:<br>
                    For example: MOD Southern Services (where the Sector is &quot;ADS4&#45;Secure&quot;)<br>
                    The drop&#45;down list will display these values in alphabetical order (A to Z).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="l5">
                    <h3><b>OCOD reference </b></h3>
                    <p>The OCOD reference edit box has a &quot;smart search&quot; feature:
                        <br>If you click in this field and start to type characters that you know are part of the reference then a drop&#45;down list will appear to show you any opportunities on OCOD that contain the characters that you have typed.
                        <br>You can select an opportunity from this list.
                        <br>When you select an OCOD reference then the Opportunity name is automatically populated for you.
                        <br>Alternatively you can press the <b>lookup</b> button, displayed as a magnifying glass icon.
                        <br>This allows you to undertake a more extensive search &#45; you will be navigated to the Search Opportunities page, where:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can narrow down your search by selecting a specific Sector to search within.</li>
                        <li>You can further narrow down by also selecting specific Account (within the Sector) to search within.</li>
                        <li>This search feature will provide a table of valid opportunities from which you can make a selection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            <div id="l6">
                <h3><b>Opportunity name</b></h3>
                <p>The Opportunity name edit box has a &quot;smart search&quot; feature:
                    <br>If you click in this field and start to type characters that you know are part of the opportunity name then a drop&#45;down list will appear to show you any opportunities on OCOD that contain the characters that you have typed.
