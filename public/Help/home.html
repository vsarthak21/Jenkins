  <h3><b>What is the Engagement Complexity Tool?</b></h3>
  <p>This <b>CP-O02-TO-001 Engagement Complexity Assessment Tool</b> is the leading risk indicator tool that is used to determine the appropriate level of surveillance and governance to ensure that we deliver in a predictable and profitable manner. </p>
  <p>Completing the engagement complexity assessment allows us to understand objectively and consistently the levels of complexity &#45; hence risk &#45; inherent in the engagements that we sell and deliver.</p>
  <p>There is a particular emphasis on completing the engagement complexity assessment at the earliest opportunity during the bid cycle. However, it should also be used on existing accounts where we are required to deliver new or additional commitments within an existing contract.</p>
  <p>Typically the engagements that we undertake will comprise of one or more programmes or projects, which may or may not lead to the delivery of services.</p>
  <p>This on-line tool has replaced the previous MS Excel version of the tool.</p>
  <p>Please refer to CP-002-WI-001 Engagement Complexity Tool Work Instruction on iQ for guidance and/or use the help functions within the application. </p>
  <p>Please also refer to the CP-O02-FR-001 Enterprise Risk Management Framework on iQ.</p>

<div id="l2">
  <h3><b>What does &quot;Engagement&quot; mean?</b></h3>
  <p>The term <b>&quot;engagement&quot;</b> is used to describe a contractual relationship that we (Sopra Steria; the Joint Ventures; or the Infrastructure Management Service Line) enter into with a client. This places price; scope; time; quality; and/or acceptance criteria obligations on us that - if not effectively managed - will result in some form of financial or reputational damage. </p>
  <p>This guidance puts a particular emphasis on completing the assessment at the earliest opportunity during the bid cycle. However, it should also be used on existing accounts where we are required to deliver new or additional commitments within an existing contract.</p>
  <p>Typically the engagements that we undertake will comprise of one or more programmes or projects that may or may not lead to the delivery of services. </p>
</div>

<div id="l3">
  <h3><b>About the Engagement Complexity Tool </b></h3>
  <p><b>What? </b>Based upon the objective assessment of fourteen complexity factors, the Engagement complexity tool determines the overall complexity rating for the Engagement in question, ranging from Very High to High, Moderate or Low complexity.</p>
  <p><b>Why? </b>The Engagement complexity tool enables a robust risk assessment. It also objectively informs key business decisions regarding the most appropriate: level of surveillance; Engagement assurance that needs to be applied; and proportionate adoption of the business management system.</p>
  <p><b>Who? </b>The completion of the Engagement complexity assessment must be a collaborative undertaking by a small team of individuals who collectively have an ability to assess all fourteen complexity factors for each Engagement. As a minimum this should include solution; commercial and delivery contributions &#45; and be owned by the Surveillance Director. </p>
  <p><b>When? </b>The Engagement complexity tool should be applied at the first opportunity during the BCR0 stage, but must have been completed prior to the BCR0c. The Engagement complexity assessment needs to be reviewed, and refined where appropriate, at each of the DCR and BCR gates thereafter.</p>
</div>

<div id="l4">
  <h3><b>Using the Engagement Complexity Tool</b></h3>
  <p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
  <p>The engagement complexity tool allows you to perform one of the following functions:
  <ol>
  <li>Create a <b>new</b> engagement complexity assessment;</li>
  <li>Update <b>an existing</b> engagement complexity assessment; and</li>
  <li>Generate a report containing engagement complexity reports generated via the complexity tool.</li>
  </ol>
  There is also a <i>Trial Feature</i> which allows you to use the complexity tool without having to actually complete and save an engagement complexity assessment.
  </p>
  <p>You can use this option via the Try the complexity assessment tool button.</p>

  <p><b>What is an engagement complexity assessment?</b></p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engagement complexity assessments are created via the tool for specific <b>opportunities;</b></li>
      <li>These opportunities are created and maintained on our Oracle CRM on Demand (<b>OCOD</b>) system;</li>
      <li>These opportunities can be either &apos;pre-sales&apos; or &apos;in delivery&apos; (i.e. contracted);</li>
      <li>An engagement complexity assessment can be performed on a number of occasions for the same opportunity &#45; the complexity of an engagement shall change over time as it progresses through our business governance and lifecycle &#45; i.e. BCR and DCR gates;</li>
      <li>The index key/unique identifier for each complexity assessment is the OCOD Reference + the Next Assessment Gate.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b>How do you complete a complexity assessment?</b></p>
  <p>The process is straight forward and requires the following steps to be followed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Select Opportunity & Gate</b>: Select the specific OCOD opportunity for which the complexity needs to be established and select the next assessment gate i.e. the next DCR or BCR gate in the business governance lifecycle;</li>
    <li><b>Fast Track?</b>: determine whether the engagement qualifies as a &quot;Fast Track&quot; complexity assessment;</li>
    <li><b>Complete the complexity assessment</b>: by completing each of the complexity factors;</li>
    <li><b>Moderate and submit</b>: determine whether the complexity assessment needs to be <i>moderated</i> and submit the complexity assessment; and</li>
    <li><b>Report</b>: download/save/print the complexity assessment report.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div id="l5">
  <h3><b>Important Security Considerations &#45; Please Read</b></h3>
  <p>Whilst the Engagement Complexity Tool has been designed for &quot;internal users&quot; (i.e. users who are employed by Sopra Steria and have a valid AD-One user name and password) 
    it is absolutely critical that data of a particularly sensitive or classified nature should not be included. 
  </p>
  <p>Where necessary, users are reminded that all data that is entered to create and update each complexity assessment is suitably obfuscated in order to protect sensitive 
    information and to ensure that all client and data confidentiality obligations are strictly adhered to.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="l6">
  <h3><b>My recent complexity assessments</b></h3>
  <p>On the Home Page you will have a table called &quot;My recent complexity assessments&quot;.</p>
  <p>This provides you with a short-cut to retrieve (and update if required) those complexity assessments that you have created or updated in recent times.</p>
  <p>
    <u>Please note</u> that only complexity assessments that you have created or updated in the last 3 months shall be shown; and a maximum of ten of your most recent complexity assessments shall be displayed<p>
  </p>
</div>

<div id="l7">
<h3><b>What reports are available?</b></h3>
<p>Whenever you create or update a complexity assessment the final stage, after you submit the engagement complexity assessment, is the option you have to download and/or print a specific engagement complexity assessment report.</p>
<p>There is also an option to generate a report (in MS Excel format) for a range of engagement complexity assessments that have been created &#45; you can select this option via the Extract reports button on this Home page.</p>
<p><b>I want to download or print the engagement complexity report for a specific engagement:</b></p>
<p>You can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <b>Update complexity assessment</b>; select the specific engagement and follow the pages through until you press the Submit button on the Moderate & Submit page. At this point you will be taken to the Download your Complexity Assessment page.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Extract reports</b>; from the Search Complexity Assessments page you can choose to select one specific engagement.
      <br>
      At this point you will be taken to the Download your Complexity Assessment page.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><b>I want to create and download or print for a range of engagement complexity assessments that have been created:</b></p>
<p>You can do this via the Extract reports button on this Home page.</p>
</div>

<div id="l8">
  <h3><b>What are the help features that are available?</b></h3>
  <p>A <b>help page</b> like this one has been created for each of the pages within the engagement complexity tool. These are always activated by clicking the &quot;Help with this page&quot; link.</p>
  <p>The help pages will always provide guidance that is specific to the page that you are on.</p>
  <ul class = "dashed">
    <li><b>Note:</b> within the engagement complexity tool the F1 button has been disabled</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We have also implemented <b>&quot;Hover on Help&quot;</b> features on a number of the fields on certain pages.</p>
  <p>Hover on Help refers to a short, explanatory message that is displayed to help clarify for you what is required when you locate the cursor &apos;above&apos; a particular field/button/feature. </p>
  <p>The message will disappear as soon as you move the cursor away from the field/button/feature.</p>
  <ul class="dashed">
    <li><b>Note:</b> Hover on Help will not function on smart phones or tablets, or where you are using &apos;touch screen&apos; to navigate through the tool</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="l9">
<h3><b>What are the user navigation features that are available?</b></h3>
<p>You will navigate through each of the pages using Next and Back buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Next</b> button will be active when all required fields on the page have been completed and will take you to the page that allows you to complete the next step on the complexity assessment process;</li>
  <li>The <b>Back</b> button will allow you to return to the previous page.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have completed and submitted your complexity assessment the <b>Home</b> button will return you to this Home page.</p>
<p>When you want to exit from the engagement complexity tool you can <b>Logout</b> by using the &quot;Log out&quot; link.</p>
<ul class="dashed">
  <li><b>Note:</b> Logging out from the application does not close the browser tab, you will need to do this manually. The tab will otherwise remain open on the Login page.</li>
</ul>
