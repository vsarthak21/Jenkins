        <h3><b>What does &quot;moderate the complexity assessment&quot; mean?</b></h3>
        <p>Moderating the complexity assessment allows you to use your professional judgement, taking in to account
            insight and information that is not available to the engagement complexity assessment tool, and &#45; where
            appropriate &#45; amending the overall engagement complexity rating.</p>
        <p>You can moderate the overall complexity rating by selecting a different value from the Moderate assessment
            drop&#45;down list.</p>
        <p>Whenever you do moderate the overall complexity assessment you need to provide a narrative to explain the
            rationale (the reasons) as to why the complexity rating has been moderated.</p>
        <p>The engagement complexity assessment tool will always default the complexity rating for a new &quot;Fast
            Track&quot; complexity assessment to Low complexity. You are able to moderate this rating to either Moderate
            or High.</p>
        <p>As you consider whether or not moderation is appropriate for this engagement please take the following
            guidance in to account:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Firstly, consider the engagement <i>environment</i>:<br>
                Factors such as business criticality; client relationship; maturity of client and subcontractor
                relationships; financial constraints etc. are likely to have
                a bearing upon the overall complexity (hence risk) of the engagement;
            </li>
            <li>
                Then consider any specific risks that the engagement is exposed to &#45; such as ambiguous scope or
                requirements; new technologies; dependencies upon the client
                or subcontractor; dependencies on key individuals and/or specialist skills; aggressive timescales etc.
                to determine whether the engagement risk exposure ; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider recent, past performance of comparable engagements and how well they have performed against key
                criteria such as achievement of:
                contracted milestones; expected margin; client satisfaction.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>On the basis of these considerations determine whether this specific engagement is, therefore, genuinely of
            Low complexity, or whether the further considerations indicate that this engagement is of Moderate or High
            complexity.</p>

    <div id="l2">
            <h3><b>What happens if I moderate the complexity assessment to Moderate or High complexity?</b></h3>
            <p>If after moderation you believe the complexity is not Low, but of a higher complexity, you should consider completing a full complexity assessment</p>
    </div>

    <div id="l3">
            <h3><b>Important Security Considerations &#45; Please Read</b></h3>
            <p>Whilst the Engagement Complexity Tool has been designed for &quot;internal users&quot; (i.e. users who are employed by Sopra Steria and have a valid AD-One user name and password) 
              it is absolutely critical that data of a particularly sensitive or classified nature should not be included. 
            </p>
            <p>Where necessary, users are reminded that all data that is entered to create and update each complexity assessment is suitably obfuscated in order to protect sensitive 
              information and to ensure that all client and data confidentiality obligations are strictly adhered to.
            </p>

    <div id="l4">
        <h3><b>How do I use this page when I am Creating a new complexity assessment?</b></h3>
        <p>The engagement complexity assessment tool will always default the complexity rating for a &quot;Fast
            Track&quot; complexity assessment to Low complexity. You are able to moderate this rating to either Moderate
            or High.</p>
        <p>Please follow the guidance provided on this help page for moderating a complexity assessment.</p>
        <p>You can moderate the overall complexity rating by selecting a different value from the Moderate assessment
            drop&#45;down list.</p>
        <p>Whenever you do moderate the overall complexity assessment you need to provide a narrative to explain the
            rationale (the reasons) as to why the complexity rating has been moderated. You will be able to enter up to 500 characters to explain why you have moderated the complexity assessment. </p>
        <p>In every case you will also need to provide a narrative to describe the suggested or planned actions to
            improve (i.e. reduce) the complexity rating. You will be able to enter up to 500 characters to define the planned actions.</p>
        <p>When you press the Submit button the &quot;Fast Track&quot; complexity assessment is completed and you will
            be taken to the next (Download your Complexity Assessment) page, from which you can download your engagement
            complexity assessment report and return to the Home page.</p>

        <h3><b>How do I use this page when I am Updating an existing complexity assessment?</b></h3>
        <p>Even if you have previously moderated the overall complexity rating for this engagement, you can change the
            moderated complexity assessment again (down or up) by selecting a different value from the Moderate
            assessment drop&#45;down list.</p>
